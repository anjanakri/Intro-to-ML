*ðŸ“Œ About the Course*

The Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning course is designed for beginners to understand:
-How to handle data.
-How to train and validate models.
-How to make predictions and improve performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebooks Overview

1. *Explore Your Data*  
   - Viewing the first few rows of data.  
   - Summary statistics with .describe().  
   - Identifying data types and spotting potential issues.

2. *Creating, Reading, and Writing*  
   - Loading data into Pandas DataFrames.  
   - Reading CSV files and writing processed data back to disk.  
   - Handling file paths and exploring datasets.

3. *Your First Machine Learning Model*  
   - Building a simple decision tree model.  
   - Training the model and making predictions.  
   - Measuring model accuracy.

4. *Model Validation*  
   - Splitting data into training and validation sets.  
   - Understanding validation scores.  
   - Avoiding data leakage.

5. *Underfitting and Overfitting*  
   - Recognizing signs of underfitting and overfitting.  
   - Using max_leaf_nodes to control model complexity.  
   - Striking the balance for better generalization.

6. *Random Forest*  
   - Introduction to the Random Forest algorithm.  
   - Comparing Random Forest with Decision Trees.  
   - Observing improvements in accuracy.
     
7. *Final Competition Submission* (Not in this repo)  
   - This notebook contains my final submission for the courseâ€™s competition.
